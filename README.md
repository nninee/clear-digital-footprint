    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="warning">WARNING!</h2>
        <p>All names are fictional, and any resemblance is coincidental. The author does not advocate for any actions. Love for the homeland!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Hygiene</strong> - a set of rules that ensure information security (not anonymity, but protection) on the Internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Valid Account</strong> - an account linked to your primary SIM card/email.</li>
            <li><strong>Deon</strong> = de-anonymization. To <strong>deon</strong> = to de-anonymize.</li>
            <li><strong>Virt</strong> = virtual number.</li>
            <li><strong>Username (ЮЗ)</strong> - account username.</li>
            <li><strong>Support (Т. П.)</strong> - technical support.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Searching for Yourself</h2>
        <p>First, we need to understand what the Internet knows about us. Search for as much information about yourself as possible using the search bar. Enter the following queries (replace name, surname, city, patronymic, etc. with your data):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"First Last City"</li>
            <li>"First Last VK"</li>
            <li>"First Last Classmates"</li>
            <li>"First Last Patronymic Date of Birth"</li>
            <li>"First Last Patronymic City"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we've Googled ourselves, let's check our accounts (most likely, your valid accounts will show up in the search, which is not good). We will return to this step later.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Deleting Accounts</h2>
        <p>At this stage, remember all your social media accounts and delete them permanently. Don't spare any pages. To make it easier to remember, you can check saved passwords in your browser. If you have forgotten your password or can't access your email, do the following:</p>
        <p>Take a photo of yourself holding your passport in one hand and a piece of paper with the ID or username of the account you lost access to. Send this photo to the technical support of the service where your page is located. In the email, include the following text: "Hello, I have lost access to the account _username_, please deactivate this page. I am attaching my passport for identity confirmation."</p>
        <p>After this trick, in 9 out of 10 cases, you won't even need to communicate with tech support, and they will simply delete your account.</p>
        <p><strong>ALSO, IT IS NECESSARY TO DELETE ALL POSTS/PRIVATE RECORDS ON ACCOUNTS!!!</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Removing Yourself from Search</h2>
        <p>At this stage, remember what the search knows about you and visit the websites containing your information. Write/call support and request to delete your information. Often, information may be on school/college websites where you studied or distinguished yourself. The "passport trick" should not be used with all services, as not everyone can be trusted with your personal data confidentiality.</p>
        <p>It is essential to hide your information from Telegram bots for de-anonymization/checking. For example, use "Eye of God" and "LeakOsint." Everything can be done in a couple of clicks, and even a novice can figure it out.</p>
